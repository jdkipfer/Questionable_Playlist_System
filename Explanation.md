Here's how the system works if done manually, the algorithm achieves the same result:

There is a playlist (main list) with a set of albums. 
The playlist for they day (day list) is created from the main list with this system at about midnight:
  1. Sort the list by play count. This divides the main list into "zones" where each zone is made up of all the songs from an album with a specific amount of plays.
  2. Select one song from each zone and add it to the day list. A song with a thumbs-up will always be selected unless there are none.

A song is removed from the main list when it reaches 7  plays, or get's a thumbs-down from the user.

There are 3 main lists: 7FAST, 7FRESH, and 7SLOW.
The names are dumb but they're chosen to make them be first and in order alphabetically in a list of playlists.
7FAST is created by adding 8 albums or about 100 songs to it when it's empty. 100% of the time, this actually happens when it's nearly empty, and I move all of the songs into 7SLOW. It's called 7FAST becasue its intended to be listened to first in the day, and because typically the playlists are not completely listened to daily, It drains the most quickly.

7FRESH is created by adding new albums as they come out. for me it usually sits between 50-100 songs, but mileage will vary. It's intended to be listened after 7FAST.

7SLOW works the same way as 7FAST, and is intended to be listened to last. It usually drains a lot more slowly than 7FAST, and this us supposed to be used to take longer to get through albums that often aren't as accessible or take longer to digest.

The program only runs for 7FAST and 7SLOW, because the amount of editing the artist and album names doesn't seem worth it to me with the amount of singles added, but this would be an easy addition if desired.
